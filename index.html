                    <h2>Welcome to my generative art experiments and musings.</h2>
                    <h3>Um, What Is This Stuff?</h3>
                    <p>This is where I post a few of the many generative art projects / experiments I&CloseCurlyQuote;ve created.</p>
                    <p>These projects are more about my coding <em>creativity</em> rather than my coding <em>skills</em>. As such, if my code cleanliness (or lack thereof) horrifies you, just know these projects happened in a flurry of creativity, with the spirit of experimentation (and yes, my professional work does follow best practices for code cleanliness).</p>
                    <p>I justed wanted a way to share my passion projects with those who are curious about them :-)</p>
                    <p><strong>Are these projects mobile-friendly?</strong> On a tablet, yes. Not so much on a phone, but you are welcome to view them that way :-)</p>

                    <p>Pierre (named after <a class="inpara" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier" target="_blank">Pierre Bezi√©r</a>) is my most ambitious project to date. It probably needs its own instruction / cheat sheet, but for now, I suggest you click on / interact with every element in the UI panel (and in the lower right corner) to get a sense of what Pierre can do. Even the points that make up the bezier curves are interactive! Try moving them around.</p>

                    <p>This project started with a simple question: Can I make a web-based Spirograph? The answer (back when I started coding) was &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;No. No you can not.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; But I did come up with this, and I think it&CloseCurlyQuote;s quite beautiful. Oh, the math equations that make it work are based on the <a class="inpara" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph" target="_blank">Spirograph</a>, so, there&CloseCurlyQuote;s that minor victory.</p>
                    <p>Much like Pierre, to get the most out of this interactive art program, click on / interact with every UI element.</p>
