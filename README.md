# Hi! Iâ€™m Jim
> Welcome to my generative art experiments and musings.

## Um, What Is This Stuff?
This is where I post a few of the many generative art projects / experiments I've created.

These projects are more about my coding *creativity* rather than my coding *skills*. As such, if my code cleanliness (or lack thereof) horrifies you, just know these projects happened in a flurry of creativity, with the spirit of experimentation (and yes, my professional work does follow best practices for code cleanliness).

I justed wanted a way to share my passion projects with those who are curious about them :-)

**Are these projects mobile-friendly?** On a tablet, yes. Not so much on a phone, but you are welcome to view them that way :-)

### Pierre - Animated Bezier Curves
See it in action here: [https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/pierre/](https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/pierre/)

Pierre (named after Pierre Bezier) is my most ambitious project to date. It probably needs its own instruction / cheat sheet, but for now, I suggest you click on / interact with every element in the UI panel (and in the lower right corner) to get a sense of what Pierre can do. Even the points that make up the bezier curves are interactive! Try moving them around.

### Twirly Thing
See it in action here: [https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/spiro-4-hsl-2/](https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/spiro-4-hsl-2/)

This project started with a simple question: Can I make a web-based Spirograph? The answer (back when I started coding) was "No. No you can not." But I did come up with this, and I think it's quite beautiful. Oh, the math equations that make it work are based on the Spirograph, so, there's that minor victory.

Much like Pierre, to get the most out of this interactive art program, click on / interact with every UI element.
