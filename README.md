### Pierre - Animated Bezier Curves
See it in action here: https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/pierre/

Pierre (named after Pierre Bezier) is my most ambitious project to date. It probably needs its own instruction / cheat sheet, but for now, I suggest you click on / interact with every element in the UI panel (and in the lower right corner) to get a sense of what Pierre can do. Even the points that make up the bezier curves are interactive! Try moving them around.

### Twirly Thing

This project started with a simple question: Can I make a web-based Spirograph? The answer (back when I started coding) was "No. No you can't". But I did come up with this, and I think it's quite beautiful.

Much like Pierre, to get the most out of this interactive art program, click on / interact with every UI element.
