## Um, Like What Is This Stuff?
Quite simply, this is where I post a few of the many generative art projects / experiments I've created.

I'm not *necessarily* trying to show off my coding skills. As such, if my code cleanliness (or lack thereof) horrifies you, just know these projects happened in a flurry of creativity, with the spirit of experimentation.

I justed wanted a way to share my passion projects with those who are curious about them :-)

**Are these projects mobile-friendly?** Well... no, not really. At least not on a phone-sized device. Yes, I know everyone's busy, on the go, living the dream, maximizing synergies, etc., and you might be viewing this on a phone. And while I cringe just a little at envoking this idea: this is art. So, the criteria is wide open. That said, they are touch-compatible (because I simply wanted to see if I could), and they look pretty good on a tablet (and it's okay to admit you have a tablet).

### Pierre - Animated Bezier Curves
See it in action here: [https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/pierre/](https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/pierre/)

Pierre (named after Pierre Bezier) is my most ambitious project to date. It probably needs its own instruction / cheat sheet, but for now, I suggest you click on / interact with every element in the UI panel (and in the lower right corner) to get a sense of what Pierre can do. Even the points that make up the bezier curves are interactive! Try moving them around.

### Twirly Thing
See it in action here: [https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/spiro-4-hsl-2/](https://jim-wolf-i-am.github.io/spiro-4-hsl-2/)

This project started with a simple question: Can I make a web-based Spirograph? The answer (back when I started coding) was "No. No you can not." But I did come up with this, and I think it's quite beautiful. Oh, the math equations that make it work are based on the Spirograph, so, there's that minor victory.

Much like Pierre, to get the most out of this interactive art program, click on / interact with every UI element.
